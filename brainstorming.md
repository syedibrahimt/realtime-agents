# 5-Minute Tutoring Brainstorming Style

## Quick Framework: **ASK → EXPLORE → CONNECT**

### **Minute 1: ASK (Set Up)**

- State the learning question clearly
- Ask: "What do you already know about this?"
- Let student share 2-3 quick thoughts
- No judgment, just listen

### **Minutes 2-3: EXPLORE (Generate Ideas)**

- Ask guiding questions:
  - "What if we tried...?"
  - "How is this like something you know?"
  - "What would happen if...?"
- Student shares ideas rapid-fire
- You write them down or encourage note-taking
- Say "Yes, and..." to build on ideas

### **Minutes 4-5: CONNECT (Wrap Up)**

- Ask: "Which idea feels strongest? Why?"
- Help student see the pattern: "Notice how you..."
- Connect to the bigger concept
- End with: "What did you discover?"

## Key Phrases to Use

- "What comes to mind when I say...?"
- "Tell me more about that"
- "How does this connect to...?"
- "What pattern do you see?"
- "That's interesting because..."

## Simple Rules

1. **No wrong answers** - every idea has value
2. **Build, don't judge** - use ideas as stepping stones
3. **Question more than tell** - let them discover
4. **Celebrate thinking** - praise the process, not just results

## Example in Action

**Topic: Fractions**

**Minute 1:** "How would you explain what half means to a 5-year-old? What do you know about half?"

**Minutes 2-3:** "What if you had a pizza... or a chocolate bar... how would you show half? What about a group of people?"

**Minutes 4-5:** "I notice you keep talking about equal parts. What does that tell us about fractions?"

**That's it! Keep it fast, focused, and question-driven.**
